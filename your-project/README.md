## Project Description
The project is an analysis about the population of Barcelona. 
The project is done in collaboration and it splits up in two distinguishes partes:
A demographic analysis about deaht, birth and vegetative ratio, and a second one, about kind of inmigration.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions about population scheduled are:

    What is the death rate by district? And by year?
    What is the most vulnerable age range (most likely to die)?
    What is the birth rate by district? By year?
    What is the vegetative ratio?
    What is the most populated neighborhood?
    What is the most used name in Barcelona? How is the name’s distribution

The questions about inmigration scheduled are:

    What is the total number of immigrants in Barcelona?
    What is the most frequent nationality? What about by District?
    Do immigrants live in districts  where mean rent is lower?


## Dataset
We use these different databeses, extracted from websites from the Ajuntament de Barcelona.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
In this case, there is no match between the differente databases, because the data is linked with different topics, like Gender (Binary data), or ranges (age).
The workflow used is grouped each data we want to check (death ratio, birth ratio, etc), for one variabale, e.g. age range, or gender. 
The presentation is introduced as the original database, and then, the data requested by the original questions. 

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
